# GIndie\Platform\Frontend 
CSS/JS frontend files for the Platform.

## Notes
The main ethos for the development of the Platform has always
been: 
1. Responsive UI (mobile first).
2. Minimal dependency on external sources.
3. Minimal dependency on JS.
Hence the use of bootstrap in the front-end + HTML5 generated from the back-end
as the general framework was deemed optimal. 
However, due to external factors some dependencies have been added and are now
engrained in the software (such as the dataTables lib).
